## Welcome to Kerberos.io ðŸ‘‹

Kerberos.io comes with a range of solutions helping you to setup a small video surveillance deployment flawlessly, with just a few cameras, and scale out to a large enterprise deployment, with thousands of cameras. It provides features to bring your own cloud (on-premise, hybrid, cloud), bring your own storage (Ceph, Minio, GCP, AWS, Azure, Storj, etc) and bring your own cameras (RTSP H264). In other words, you run the show!

## A Kerberos.io architecture ðŸ“š

Within Kerberos.io we support containerisation and scalability by default. This means that any solution you'll find in our solution stack is shipped as a container natively and on the platform you desire: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, OpenShift or as a static binary through various package manager such as Snap.

Each component in the Kerberos.io architecture can be installed how and where you want. This means you can create hybrid scenarios, or go for a full-cloud or full-onpremise deployment.
