## Welcome to Kerberos.io ðŸ‘‹

Kerberos.io comes with a range of tools allowing you to start a small home deployment, with a few cameras and scale out to a large enterprise deployment, with thousands of cameras. It provides features to bring your own cloud (on-premise, hybrid, cloud), bring your own storage (Ceph, Minio, GCP, AWS, Azure, Storj, etc) and bring your own cameras (RTSP H264). You are the one who's running the show!

## A Kerberos.io architecture ðŸ“š

Within Kerberos.io we support containerisation by default. This means that any solution you'll find below is shipped as a container on the platform you desire: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, OpenShift or as a static binary through various package manager such as Snap.

Each component in the Kerberos.io architecture can be installed how and where you want. This means you can create hybrid scenarios, or go for a full-cloud or full-onpremise deployment.
